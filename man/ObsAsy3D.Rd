\arguments{
\item{data}{(a) For \code{datatype = "abundance"}, data can be input as a vector of species abundances (for a single assemblage), matrix/data.frame (species by assemblages), or a list of species abundance vectors. \cr
(b) For \code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}, data can be input as a list of matrices/data.frames (species by sampling units); data can also be input as a single matrix/data.frame by merging all sampling units across assemblages based on species identity; in this case, the number of sampling units (\code{nT}, see below) must be specified.}

\item{diversity}{selection of diversity type: \code{'TD'} = Taxonomic diversity, \code{'PD'} = Phylogenetic diversity, and \code{'FD'} = Functional diversity.}

\item{q}{a numerical vector specifying the diversity orders. Default is \code{seq(0, 2, by = 0.2)}.}

\item{datatype}{data type of input data: individual-based abundance data (\code{datatype = "abundance"}) or species by sampling-units incidence/occurrence matrix (\code{datatype = "incidence_raw"}) with all entries being 0 (non-detection) or 1 (detection).}

\item{nboot}{a positive integer specifying the number of bootstrap replications when assessing sampling uncertainty and constructing confidence intervals. Enter 0 to skip the bootstrap procedures. Default is 50.}

\item{conf}{a positive number < 1 specifying the level of confidence interval. Default is 0.95.}

\item{nT}{(required only when \code{datatype = "incidence_raw"} and input data in a single matrix/data.frame) a vector of positive integers specifying the number of sampling units in each assemblage. If assemblage names are not specified (i.e., \code{names(nT) = NULL}), then assemblages are automatically named as "assemblage1", "assemblage2",..., etc.}

\item{method}{Select \code{'Asymptotic'} or \code{'Observed'}.}

\item{PDtree}{(required argument for \code{diversity = "PD"}), a phylogenetic tree in Newick format for all observed species in the pooled assemblage.}

\item{PDreftime}{(argument only for \code{diversity = "PD"}), a vector of numerical values specifying reference times for PD. Default is \code{NULL} (i.e., the age of the root of \code{PDtree}).}

\item{PDtype}{(argument only for \code{diversity = "PD"}), select PD type: \code{PDtype = "PD"} (effective total branch length) or \code{PDtype = "meanPD"} (effective number of equally divergent lineages). Default is \code{"meanPD"}, where \code{meanPD = PD/tree depth}.}

\item{FDdistM}{(required argument for \code{diversity = "FD"}), a species pairwise distance matrix for all species in the pooled assemblage.}

\item{FDtype}{(argument only for \code{diversity = "FD"}), select FD type: \code{FDtype = "tau_values"} for FD under specified threshold values, or \code{FDtype = "AUC"} (area under the curve of tau-profile) for an overall FD which integrates all threshold values between zero and one. Default is \code{"AUC"}.}

\item{FDtau}{(argument only for \code{diversity = "FD"} and \code{FDtype = "tau_values"}), a numerical vector between 0 and 1 specifying tau values (threshold levels). If \code{NULL} (default), then threshold is set to be the mean distance between any two individuals randomly selected from the pooled assemblage (i.e., quadratic entropy).}

\item{FDcut_number}{(argument only for \code{diversity = "FD"} and \code{FDtype = "AUC"}), a numeric number to cut [0, 1] interval into equal-spaced sub-intervals to obtain the AUC value by integrating the tau-profile. Equivalently, the number of tau values that will be considered to compute the integrated AUC value. Default is \code{FDcut_number = 50}. A larger value can be set to obtain more accurate AUC value.}
}
\value{
a data frame including the following information/statistics: 
\item{Assemblage}{the name of assemblage.}
\item{Order.q}{the diversity order of q.}
\item{qTD, qPD, qFD}{the estimated asymptotic diversity or observed diversity of order q.} 
\item{s.e.}{standard error of diversity.}
\item{qTD.LCL, qPD.LCL, qFD.LCL and qTD.UCL, qPD.UCL, qFD.UCL}{the bootstrap lower and upper confidence limits for the diversity of order q at the specified level (with a default value of 0.95).}
\item{Method}{\code{"Asymptotic"} means asymptotic diversity and \code{"Observed"} means observed diversity.}
\item{Reftime}{the reference times for PD.}
\item{Type}{\code{"PD"} (effective total branch length) or \code{"meanPD"} (effective number of equally divergent lineages) for PD.}
\item{Tau}{the threshold of functional distinctiveness between any two species for FD (under \code{FDtype = tau_values}).}
}
\description{
\code{ObsAsy3D} computes observed and asymptotic diversity of order q between 0 and 2 (in increments of 0.2) for 3D diversity; these 3D values with different order q can be used to depict a q-profile in the \code{ggObsAsy3D} function.\cr\cr 
It also computes observed and asymptotic PD for various reference times by specifying the argument \code{PDreftime}; these PD values with different reference times can be used to depict a time-profile in the \code{ggObsAsy3D} function.\cr\cr
It also computes observed and asymptotic FD for various threshold tau levels by specifying the argument \code{FDtau}; these FD values with different threshold levels can be used to depict a tau-profile in the \code{ggObsAsy3D} function.\cr\cr
For each dimension, by default, both the observed and asymptotic diversity estimates will be computed.
